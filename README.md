# Making a document

DocPad supports asset pipelining so that you can make your document with any formats you like.

For example, if you want you create a HTML document with Markdown format, you put the file named *pagename.html.md* into the *src/document* folder.

Note that you have to have the renderer which can handle the format you set to the extension of the document.
